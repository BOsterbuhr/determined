**New Features**

-  CLI: A new CLI command has been added ``det user edit <target_user> [--display-name]
   [--remote/--no-remote] [--activate/--deactivate] [--admin/--no-admin] [--username]`` that allows
   the user to edit mutliple fields for the target user. Old methods for editing users will still be
   available, but depricated.
